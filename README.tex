    \section{Project Proposal}
    The goal of this project will be to recreate the Windows XP version of the classic game, minesweeper. The visual style I'd like to reach can be seen at http://www.freeminesweeper.org/minecore.html. 
    \subsection{Project Motivation}
    This game is one of my all-time favorite games to play when I have few minutes of free time. I've always wanted to try to build my own copy, and now seems as good of a time as any.
    \section{Design Proposal}
    The majority of this game is expected to be written in MASM assembly, with possible exception being in the Graphical User Interface, which may end up being written in C++, where the C++ program will listen for events on the GUI, but trigger functions written in Assembly.
    \subsection{Design Steps}
    The following goals will be expected to be built in MASM assembly:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Randomly populating mines within a 2D array
    \item Calculating how many mines are adjacent to a given index in 2D array
    \item Track time since the beginning of a round
    \item Keep track of how many mines remain unmarked
    \item Track statistics and win conditions
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Design Challenges}
    The primary challenges of this project, aside from implementing the GUI if it is written in MASM instead of C++, will be manipulating any time values, specifically for generating random indexes to fill the array with mines, and for the timer.
